-- To check the Git log
1. git log
2. git log --oneline ( To get list of logs as one liner)
3. git log --stat
    This command:
    displays the file(s) that have been modified
    displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
    displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed

-- Get out of Git log list -> Press q key

-- To display actual changes made 
The git log command has a flag that can be used to display the actual changes made to a file. The flag is --patch which can be shortened to just -p:
-> git log -p

-- If you know the SHA use the below command to view the changes made in particular commit 
->git log -p fdf5493
Equivalent cmd -> git show SHAcode

-- To remove files of the commit made, which are not moved yet and are in the staging area.
->git rm --cached  (will not destroy any of your work; it just removes it from the Staging Index.)

-- The Period .
The period refers to the current directory and can be used as a shortcut to refer to all files and directories (including all nested files and directories!).
-> git add . 

-- To make a commit
